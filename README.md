## Hi there 👋

Hi there 👋

I’m Katarzyna, Business Intelligence & Operations Analyst based in Poland.

I work with data to build clear analyses, dashboards, and lightweight automations that support operational and business decision-making. My focus is on clean data structures, reproducible analysis, and solutions that can be easily handed over and maintained.

I have experience working in both regulated corporate environments and fast-moving startup settings, including remote and async collaboration with international teams.

### What I work with
- Python for data analysis and automation
- SQL for data extraction and transformation
- BI tools: Looker Studio, Power BI
- Google Workspace (Sheets, AppScript) as well as Microsoft Workspace (Excel, VBA) for reporting and workflow automation
- SaaS integrations and operational tooling

### Selected projects
- **Pairs Trading Strategy (Python)** – financial data analysis focused on identifying statistically related asset pairs and mean-reversion behaviour  
- **Operational & Financial Data Analysis (Python)** – risk analysis, statistical diagnostics, and reporting-ready datasets  
- **Business Intelligence Dashboard** – interactive sales and performance dashboards with structured data models

Each repository includes a short description and reproducible code.
